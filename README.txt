Hell hounds, is a small chatroom proyect which encrypts the chat using AES in order to prevent
intruders from spying on your messages, this complete software is developed by Pentabonyx Labs

to assemble the program it is required to execute the command as: 
 ./compile.sh --client-audio

RUN AS SUDO!!!!

this program should try to setup the development environtment for the proyect

explaining the source code structure:
    * assets  - contains all the resources for the program, such as icons, images, 3d models
    * include - has different headers required for optimal work (mostly not the core)
    * lib     - includes all the third party libraries required for the program to work
    * server  - this has the PHP scripts and the MySQL database required for communication
    * src     - this has the core code of the program (the most important folder)
    ---------------
    compile.sh - a small script that builds the program
    imgui.ini  - just the setup of the gui interface (automatically generated)
    main.cpp   - the main file to build the program

 This is the complete code of Firestorm Source Engine written in C++ using OpenGL.
 It should be buildable on Windows and Linux, but it's not tested on windows.

 The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  
 You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
 anything you want with the code, except selling your new version, unless we 
 get to an agreement.  The catch is that if you distribute new binary versions,
 you are required to make the entire source code available for free to everyone.

 The primary intent of this release is for entertainment and educational 
 purposes, but the GPL does allow commercial exploitation if you obey the 
 full license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear 
 to have your source changes released, we could still negotiate a separate 
 license agreement (for $$$), but I would encourage you to just live with the 
 GPL.
